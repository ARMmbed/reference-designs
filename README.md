**Reference Design Portfolio**

Reference Designs are tested and proven starting points targeted towards the creation of Pelion Ready Development Boards and End Products.  Designed to provide your product with the IoT subsystem, these Reference Designs can be customised with any sensors and output devices as dictated by the use case thus removing the complexities around connectivity and device management. 

These Reference Hardware designs consist of four main components: Radio, MCU, Memory and secure element; often two or more may be integrated in a single chip by some silicon vendors.
