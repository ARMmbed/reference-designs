**Reference Design Portfolio**

Reference Designs are tested and proven starting points targeted towards the creation of Pelion Ready Development Boards and End Products.  Designed to provide your product with the IoT subsystem, these Reference Designs can be customised with any sensors and output devices as dictated by the use case thus removing the complexities around connectivity and device management. 


Below are links to all of the Reference Designs which have been developed to support the Pelion Cloud Platform:
