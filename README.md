**Reference Design Portfolio**

Reference Designs are tested and proven starting points targeted towards the creation of Pelion Ready Development Boards and End Products.  Designed to provide your product with the IoT subsystem, these Reference Designs can be customised with any sensors and output devices as dictated by the use case thus removing the complexities around connectivity and device management. 

These Reference Hardware designs consist of four main components: Radio, MCU, Memory and secure element; often two or more may be integrated in a single chip by some silicon vendors.

If you follow the logical design in these schematics your product will achieve Mbed Enabled and Pelion Ready certifications and therefore compatible with the entire Mbed Ecosystem.  Note, these designs are for the IoT subsystem not a complete end product, you will need to connect input and output devices of your choice but thatâ€™s typically very simple because our components page already has examples for over 500 different sensors and output transducers.


Below are links to all of the Reference Designs which have been developed to support the Pelion Cloud Platform:  

### Wi-Fi Reference Designs

WiFi needs little introduction, often found in commercial and home environments, its IP based to the edge and gives direct connectivity to the internet via a standard Access Point.  Click here to browse the available Mbed + Pelion WiFi designs.

### NB-IoT Reference Designs

NB_IoT (officially known as LTE Cat NB1) is a cellular communications standard which addresses the the LPWAN (low-power, wide-area network) market. Adopted in sereral markets such as Smart metering (electricity, gas, and water), facility management services, asset tracking and personal health monitors, and smart city infrastructure such as street lamps or dustbins.
